# UFOs
## Purpose of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to create a webpage that uploads a table of ufo's sightings, and allows a user to filter the data based on date, city, state, country, and shape of UFO.

## Results
Originally, we only had one filter, date, and it was initialized by clicking a button. When we added the other filters we removed the button and initialized the filter on the user pressing enter. Now, a user can choose which filters they want to use. If they want to use a combination of a few of the filters, or just one filter, they are able to by typing in a input into one of the the [Input Boxes](static/images/input_box.png).

## Summary
One major drawback from this new design is that filters require an exact match in order to work. If the user makes any mistakes when typing the filters it will not filter the data properly. For further development, I'd incorporate a more flexible input box. I'd also include something that would allow the user to export their filtered table so they are able to maniuplate the data on their own.
